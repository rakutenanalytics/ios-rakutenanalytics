/**
 * Main class of the module.
 *
 * This class handles:
 *
 *  - Enabling or disabling **location tracking** with #shouldTrackLastKnownLocation;
 *  - Enabling or disabling **[advertising identifier (IDFA)](https://developer.apple.com/reference/adsupport/asidentifiermanager) tracking** with #shouldTrackAdvertisingIdentifier.
 *  - **Spooling** @ref RSDKAnalyticsRecord instances with @ref RSDKAnalyticsManager::spoolRecord:.
 *  - **Gathering system data** that it merges with each record it spools. See the next section.
 *
 * ## Automatically gathered system data
 * The fields below, documented in the [Rakuten Analytics Generic IDL](https://git.rakuten-it.com/projects/RG/repos/rg/browse/ratGeneric.idl),
 * are automatically merged with the properties of each @ref RSDKAnalyticsRecord that gets spooled:
